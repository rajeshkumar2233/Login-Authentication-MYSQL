# Login-Authentication-MYSQL

Node.js Login System with Express, JWT & MySQL

Node.js + MySQL : Add Forgot/Reset Password to Login-Authentication System.

We create a Node.js application that runs on our local server. For this purpose we have a MySQL database where our user data is stored. For authentication we have to query this data and can open a session for the user with the help of the JWT (JSON Web Token) extension.
